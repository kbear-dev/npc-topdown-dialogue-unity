# npc-topdown-dialogue-unity
This is a Unity NPC Dialogue system I made in my spare time.

The setup is mainly designed for top-down/platformer-type games. 

Core features of this build includes:
1. NPC Dialogue System
2. Interaction Detection  
3. Player Controls 

Future developments:
1. Non-linear Dialogue
    a. Player Decision System
    b. Morality System
2. Talk Sprites
3. Dialogue Parser (external file to data)

I'm not exactly sure with the direction of this build, but it's 
going somewhere for sure. Definitely going to incorporate this
in my future projects.
